# CRUD test app API client service

This is my first app using newer angular version (last one I used was version 1.0) and TypeScript. Due to limited time constraints I'm not 100% satisfied to my code quality. But this was fun learning experience :)

## Main stack

* AngularJs 7
* Material UI

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
